# Network Packet Analyzer

A packet sniffer, also known as a network analyzer, is a tool used to capture and analyze network traffic. It can display various pieces of information about the packets it captures, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, and payload data. This tool is essential for network diagnostics and troubleshooting, but its use should always be ethical and in compliance with legal regulations.

## Components of a Packet Sniffer

1. Packet Capture: The core function of a packet sniffer is to capture network packets. This can be done using libraries like libpcap in C/C++ or scapy/pcapy in Python.

2. Packet Analysis: Once packets are captured, the tool should be able to analyze them to extract meaningful information, such as IP addresses, protocols, and payload.
 
3. User Interface: A user-friendly interface to display the captured and analyzed data. This can be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).


## Tools and Libraries


1. Python: Python is a popular language for writing packet sniffers due to its simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries.

2. Scapy: A powerful Python library for packet manipulation. It can capture, dissect, and forge network packets.

3. PyPCAP: A Python extension module that interfaces with the libpcap packet capture library.


## Steps to Develop a Packet Sniffer


### 1. Setup Environment:


Install Python if it's not already installed.

Install necessary libraries:

* pip install scapy

* pip install pypcap

### 2. Capture Packets:

Use scapy to capture network packets. Here's a basic example:

from scapy.all import sniff

def packet_callback(packet):
    print(packet.show())

* Capture 10 packets
sniff(prn=packet_callback, count=10)


### 3. Analyze Packets:

* Extract relevant information from captured packets:

from scapy.all import sniff

def packet_callback(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(IP):
        ip_layer = packet.getlayer(IP)
        print(f"Source: {ip_layer.src}, Destination: {ip_layer.dst}, Protocol: {ip_layer.proto}")
    
sniff(prn=packet_callback, count=10)


### 4. Display Information:

Format and display the captured data in a readable format. You can enhance the display by using a GUI library like tkinter for a simple GUI, or more advanced libraries like PyQt or Kivy.
